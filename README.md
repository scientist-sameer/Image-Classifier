# Image-Classifier

### Project Overview 
In this project I am using deep learning with PyTorch to make an image classifier that predicts the top K flower classes and their associated probabilities from a picture.    

### Project Files
The `image_classifier.ipynb` file contains the Jupyter Notebook for the design, training, testing and evaluation of the deep learning model.  The files `model_ic.py`, `utils_ic.py`, `train.py`, `predict.py` convert the model into a command line application. `train.py` trains a new network on a dataset and saves the model as a checkpoint. `predict.py` uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.  I have completed this project according to the standards and formats decided by Udacity
